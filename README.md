# NGAC-graph-UI
NGAC ([Next Generation Access Control](https://www.nist.gov/patents/next-generation-access-control-system-and-process-controlling-database-access)) user interface for a frontend 
project built on the [cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) library. The UI provides easy-to-use features for creating and editing access control policies in accordance with 
the NGAC framework.

The full project version of this UI together with a complete front end solution can be found at [github.com/Emn98/D0020E](https://github.com/Emn98/D0020E), there you'll
find added features for database integration, file handling and more.

## Directed acyclic graph version
An alternative DAG version is also included in this repository, this layout is more in line with what the originators of NGAC had in mind but was not part of our final 
solution due to the visual increase in data and inconveniences with layout management.
